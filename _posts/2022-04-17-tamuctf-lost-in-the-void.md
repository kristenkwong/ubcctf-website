>Help! I've lost my private key somehow, and I need you to--

>Okay, look, I was going to make a meaningful and CTF-y story for this challenge, but the scenario really wasn't making sense. You just need to decrypt enc.bin. Here's the source code we used to generate the challenge and a memory dump; good luck!

## Understanding the challenge
We are given a core dump file, along with a rust source file for this challenge. The code is quite simple:
```rs
use rand::SeedableRng;
use rand_chacha::ChaChaRng;
use rsa::{PaddingScheme, PublicKey, RsaPrivateKey, RsaPublicKey};
use tokio::fs::File;
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};
use tokio::process::Command;
use zeroize::Zeroizing;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let mut rng = ChaChaRng::from_entropy();
    let key = RsaPrivateKey::new(&mut rng, 4096)?;
    let pubkey = RsaPublicKey::from(&key);

    {
        let mut plaintext = Zeroizing::new(Vec::new());
        File::open("flag.txt").await?.read_to_end(&mut plaintext).await?;

        let ciphertext = Zeroizing::new(pubkey.encrypt(&mut rng, PaddingScheme::PKCS1v15Encrypt, &plaintext)?);
        File::create("enc.bin").await?.write_all(&ciphertext).await?;
    }


    Command::new("gcore").arg(std::process::id().to_string()).spawn().unwrap().wait().await?;

    Ok(())
}
```
We can see that it generates a random RSA key pair with the cryptographically secure `ChaCha20` algorithm, reads the flag and encrypts it using the generated public key, then generates a core dump.

One thing of note here is that both the plaintext and ciphertext is [zeroizing](https://docs.rs/zeroize/latest/zeroize/), and the scope ended before the `gcore` command is invoked - this means that we are highly unlikely to be able to obtain the flag in the core dump itself, and we will actually have to obtain the key pair to solve this challenge. Grepping for the flag proves this right:
```
$ grep 'gigem' core.4179
$
```
To reconstruct a RSA private key in most languages, we would need the modulus `n`, the public exponent `e`, and the private exponent `d`. Since `n` is made of 2 very large primes `p` and `q`, we can use a [prime finder](https://github.com/ZetaTwo/prime-finder) and recover the rest of the data using some maths.

Or alternatively, we can just figure out how rust structures work and grab the components ourselves. Totally not because I didn't even think of that method until I talked with the author Addison himself after the ctf ended. Yep.
<br><br><br>

## Rust & Structs
To be able to understand where to obtain the data directly from the core dump, we first need to know how the data is represented in memory. Since we only have the source code, not a compiled binary, the first thing to do is to compile it - with a quick run of `cargo init`, copy `main.rs` to the `src` directory, and add the required dependencies to `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8"
rand_chacha = "0.3"
tokio = {version = "1.17.0", features = ["full"]}
anyhow = "1"
rsa = "0.5"
zeroize = "1"
```
We can then run `cargo build` and obtain the resultant binary. Note that this binary is probably not identical to the one used to generate the core dump due to potential version differences, but the data structures should be similar enough for us to identify a pattern. Let's breakpoint at right after the key is generated, and run it in a debugger to see what it looks like:

![struct.png](/assets/images/tamuctf2022/lost-in-the-void/struct.png)

Hmm, seems like `v29` is the variable we want, but yikes - what even is `gap0`? Even with DWARF debug information, it is not doing much good for us:
```c
v29 - core::result::Result<rsa::key::RsaPrivateKey,rsa::errors::Error>:
{gap0={0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0x41,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0x60,0x21,0x2F,0x65,0x8F,0x55,0,0,0x40,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0x40,0x21,0x2F,0x65,0x8F,0x55,0,0,0x41,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0xE0,0x21,0x47,0xC1,0xFD,0x7F,0,0,0xE0,0x21,0x47,0xC1,0xFD,0x7F,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0x40,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0xA0,0xF7,0x2E,0x65,0x8F,0x55,0,0,0x40,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0x40,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0x30,0xDC,0x2E,0x65,0x8F,0x55,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0x20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0x30,6,0x2F,0x65,0x8F,0x55,0,0,0x20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0x20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0x20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0x90,0xA,0x2F,0x65,0x8F,0x55,0,0,0x20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0x20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0x20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0xD0,0xDD,0x2E,0x65,0x8F,0x55,0,0,0x20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0x20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0xFE,0x2E,0x65,0x8F,0x55,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}}
```
But wait - if we look closer at the hex view, it looks like there are multiple pointers in the struct. Will those be pointing to what we are looking for, and why is it just a giant blob of data even with DWARF? Turns out, `gap0` represents all dynamically changing data types that might have different data types in it depending on situation. For example, `std::Result` can store either a `rsa::key::RsaPrivateKey` or a `rsa::errors::Error` blob, even though we don't really care about data containing the error type usually. If we can fix the struct declaration to the one we want to analyse, we can most likely obtain the correct values and their offset without needing to guess, which we can then map to that in the core dump.

Luckily for us, there is a [cheat sheet](https://cheats.rs/#standard-library-types) for some of the common internal representations of rust structures. From there, we can see that `std::Result` basically prepends a `usize` tag, which is 8 bytes in a 64 bit system, to the data that it stores if it succeeded, which is `rsa::key::RsaPrivateKey` for our case.

In IDA, we can achieve this by first utilizing `expand struct type` to expand by 8 byte (size of `__int64`) and converting it into `data`, `set type` to `__int64`, then select `struct var` on `gap0` to convert it to `rsa::key::RsaPrivateKey` (`field_0` and `gap_0` has also been renamed to `tag` and `keydata` for clarity):

![newstruct.png](/assets/images/tamuctf2022/lost-in-the-void/newstruct.png)

Looking much more *structural* now! It also matches the struct layout defined in the [official source code](https://docs.rs/rsa/0.4.0/src/rsa/key.rs.html#47-50) for `rsa::key::RsaPrivateKey` and `rsa::key::RsaPublicKey`:
```rs
pub struct RSAPublicKey {
    n: BigUint,
    e: BigUint,
}

/// Represents a whole RSA key, public and private parts.
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
#[cfg_attr(
    feature = "serde",
    derive(Serialize, Deserialize),
    serde(crate = "serde_crate")
)]
pub struct RSAPrivateKey {
    /// Public components of the private key.
    pubkey_components: RSAPublicKey,
    /// Private exponent
    pub(crate) d: BigUint,
    /// Prime factors of N, contains >= 2 elements.
    pub(crate) primes: Vec<BigUint>,
    /// precomputed values to speed up private operations
    #[cfg_attr(feature = "serde", serde(skip))]
    pub(crate) precomputed: Option<PrecomputedValues>,
}
```
However, some of the data is still not yet matched with the same `gap0` issue, especially the ones that are of the `SmallVecData<u64_ 4>` type, which holds the component data. At this point we can already vaguely guess what the values and pointers are for, but just to be safe, let's go a step further and fix that too.

As defined in the [smallvec source code](https://docs.rs/smallvec/1.5.1/src/smallvec/lib.rs.html#472-478), it has a 1 byte tag, along with either inlined data up to 4 `u64` ints, or a `u64` heap pointer (`usize`) and a `usize` capacity int:
```rs
pub struct SmallVec<A: Array> {
    // The capacity field is used to determine which of the storage variants is active:
    // If capacity <= Self::inline_capacity() then the inline variant is used and capacity holds the current length of the vector (number of elements actually in use).
    // If capacity > Self::inline_capacity() then the heap variant is used and capacity holds the size of the memory allocation.
    capacity: usize,
    data: SmallVecData<A>,
}

(...)

#[cfg(feature = "union")]
union SmallVecData<A: Array> {
    inline: MaybeUninit<A>,
    heap: (*mut A::Item, usize),
}
```
Since everything is a `u64` on 64 bit systems, we can just set it to an `__int64* u64[4]` pointer array with an `__int64 tag` at the front in IDA for a good enough generalization that shows both literal values and a portion of the dereferenced values. With that, we can finally obtain a good view of what each value means:

![structglory.png](/assets/images/tamuctf2022/lost-in-the-void/structglory.png)

From the memory location column, we can infer the following:
- n is obtainable after dereferencing pointer at struct offset `0x7FFDC1472568 - 0x7FFDC1472550 = +0x18`,
- e is the inline int `0x10001` (or `65537`), which is the default value for most RSA implementations and does not change,
- d is obtainable after dereferencing pointer at struct offset `0x7FFDC14725C8 - 0x7FFDC1472550 = +0x78`.

To verify if we set the struct correctly, let's debug print the private key generated by adding the line `println!("{:?}", key);` in the source and compiling, and compare it with the debugging values we obtain from the struct data in IDA:

![comparedata.png](/assets/images/tamuctf2022/lost-in-the-void/comparedata.png)
<div style="font-size:80%">(omitted unrelated data and slightly reformatted for clarity.)</div>
`4959635403563789489` is `0x44D42A1F4CDEECB1`, `65537` is `0x10001`, and `11540142137781311521` is `0xA026D221CBF8D821`...

Yep - looks the same to me! With that, we can finally move on to applying the offsets to the core dump itself.

Firing up `gdb`, we can see which function frame we are currently at, along with the register values:

```

Since it calls `gcore` by invoking `Command::spawn`, along with potential version differences, we cannot guarantee that the variable offsets from the stack pointer is gonna be the same. However, it should be in a similar offset from `rsp` as `v29` is, aka `$rsp+0x2D0` - we can just look around that general location for the `tag` and `capacity` values that will not change since the key sizes are fixed.
```

Seems like all 512 bytes (4096 bit as set in the `RSAPrivateKey` constructor) for both `n` and `d` are populated, which is exactly what we want to see! Time to whip up a script using the bytes we got and try to decrypt `enc.bin`:
