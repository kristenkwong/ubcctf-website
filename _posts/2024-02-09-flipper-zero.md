## Background

On February 8 2024, the Ministry of Public Safety [released a statement][stmt] that, following the National Summit on Combatting Auto Theft, they intend to take various actions to discourage auto theft. This is in response to a large amount of auto theft, and there are [various][story1] stories [about cars being stolen in Canada and shipped overseas][story2] to be sold.

As part of these actions, the Government of Canada wishes to ban certain hardware development tools like the Flipper Zero that have been used to steal some cars which have faulty security design. These tools have many legitimate uses such as security evaluation, understanding interoperability, and learning about wireless communication.

Such cars have severe design flaws in the security of their keyless entry systems, comparable to if they had locks that could be opened with a normal screwdriver. The government wishes to do the equivalent of banning screwdrivers instead of holding auto manufacturers to account for their faulty security and demanding recalls to fix the cars.

We, as the future generation of computer security professionals, engineers, and potential future designers of car security systems, believe this is an extremely counterproductive course of action.

Maple Bacon is a competitive computer security Capture the Flag team at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, which has won multiple international computer security competitions.

We at Maple Bacon are requesting that you help us write to our politicians to stop this.

## Why is banning the Flipper Zero a Bad Idea?

When talking to politicans and officials, it's important to explain, in a short and **non-technical** manner, why banning the Flipper Zero is a bad idea. Here are some ideas of points to bring up.

We request that you don't copy-paste our blog post into letters, but feel free to take information and points in your own writing.

### Banning the Flipper Zero harms the Right to Repair and Interoperability

Part of what the Flipper Zero does is allow individuals to intercept and analyze wireless signals transmitted from any device. This is important to analyze what is contained in these signals, so that people can then create and modify various new innovative systems to let different devices work with each other. It is also used to help analyze and fix broken systems and devices by analyzing and transmitting certain digital signals.

Every single Federal Party has annouced their support for Right to Repair and Interoperability. Bill C-244 (which supports the Right to Repair) and Bill C-294 (which supports interoperability) both passed the House of Commons *unanimously*. It is important to hold the parties to account on their continued support of these key principles. 

### Banning the Flipper Zero harms public safety and national security

The Communication Security Establishment and the Canadian Center for Cybersecurity have both made it clear that Canada has a cybersecurity skills shortage. With foreign threats targeting everything from smart toothbrushes to water systems to our very democracy, Canada needs people with the skills to protect Canadians from cyberthreats. However, this ban would only seek to prevents students and young people from having opportunities to gain the advanced technical skills needed to contribute to the security of Canada.

It is also a key principle in cybersecurity that security by obsurity is not security at all. By taking away tools for law abiding experts to analyze and investigate systems ranging from cars to industrial control systems, you are basically allowing the "bad guys" to look for holes to exploit without letting the "good guys" find those same holes in order to fix them. This poses a clear risk to critical infrastructure and public safety. 

### Banning the Flipper Zero doesn't help prevent car crimes (or any crimes)

The Flipper Zero is made out of generic chips costing less than $10, which are exactly the same as the ones used in consumer products with wireless functionality, such as smart light bulbs, garage door openers, and possibly even some cars. Criminals can make purpose-built devices that do the same thing for the purposes of stealing insecure cars or committing other crimes, using these same chips in a new design.

It is very easy to build electronics these days, which is fantastic for innovation. But, this also means that if something is insecure and can be exploited with simple hardware, such hardware is cheap to make. We estimate that a custom device with equivalent wireless functionality to the Flipper could be built as a one-off prototype for less than $150, and less in higher quantities; notably less than the Flipper itself that sells for $200.

The issue with car theft observed is that the cars are insecure. The situation with cars that have this issue is like if they had locks on them that could be opened by a regular screwdriver. We can't ban screwdrivers, the problem here is that the cars' locks should not be possible to open with a screwdriver.

We cannot ban the chips either because they have a huge number of non-malicious uses and have innumerable alternatives, and doing so would significantly hurt Canadian industry, while doing very little to nothing to stop thieves getting them into the country. Commercial devices with the chips could equally be reprogrammed to send malicious data; there is no conceivable regulation scheme that would stop these from being used for stealing insecure cars.

### It is impossible to craft a regulation to ban all software defined radio capable devices without impacting vital systems

It will likely be proposed to use the Radiocommunications Act to regulate the chips in the Flipper Zero, otherwise known as software defined radios. SDRs are used in almost every aspect of our daily lives. From phones and drones to industrial control systems and access control systems, it would be impossible to craft amendments to the Radiocommunications Regulations that would stop the sale of malicious products and allow these legitimate products, *because they are one and the same*. 

### It is letting the automakers off the hook for bad security while handing them wins in damaging the right to repair

It is interesting and worth mentioning that this ban lets automakers get away with having bad and cheap security, while banning tools that would allow individuals to repair and modify their vehicles outside of the manufacturer monopoly, something the manufacturers have been fighting for decades. 

### (For Vancouver MPs) This ban will impact Vancouver's role as a technology hub

Vancouver is recognized as a place for international collaboration on technology and cybersecurity. Pwn2Own, a world-renowned international cybersecurity challenge held at the CanSecWest conference, is one example of why cybersecurity experts around the world know that Vancouver plays and can continue to play a leading role in future cybersecurity innovation. Banning the Flipper Zero, which is commonly used by attendees at Pwn2Own in Vancouver and by cybersecurity experts in general, will risk this 15 year conference leaving Canada for the United States, and further accelerate the brain drain of Canadian and Vancouverite talent to the US. 

## Party specific messaging

If you wish to play politics, here is some messaging that connects to the platforms and views of each party.

### Conservatives

> I know that you are well aware that banning tools used by law abiding citizens across this country through heavy handed cabinet regulation does not keep Canada safe. Instead of focusing on common sense policing measures or fixing the broken criminal justice system, the Trudeau-Liberal-NDP government instead looks to find something to ban.

### NDP

> Instead of forcing automobile manufacturers to step up and build cars that are actually hard to steal, Liberals would rather follow the lead of the automobile manufacturers and ban a tool that allows ordinary hobbyists analyze and understand the digital components of cars and trucks so they can safely and effectively repair and modify their vehicles, bypassing the manufacturer monopoly

## How to send messages to the Government

The ideal way to send messages to the government is writing letters. They are much harder to ignore and imply more effort. You do not need to be a citizen to send letters to the government. It is possible to email as well.

We kindly ask that you minimize the usage of ChatGPT or similar tools in writing letters to politicians. Although sheer volume of letters is appreciated and important, we are writing to human beings and it's most effective to write quality letters.

Recommendation: write a letter that is relevant to multiple MPs and send copies to multiple MPs.

*No postage is required to send letters to Parliament.*
