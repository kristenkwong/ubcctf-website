## TL;DR
Sometimes brute reversing things is not the way to go, especially when they are heavily guarded - there usually are smarter ways to trick the programs, such as proxying dynamically linked libraries.

## Investigation and Preliminary Patching

As with most rev challenges, it provided us a binary and no nc endpoints to connect to. So the first thing to do is of course to try running it and get a sense of how it works (~~who doesn't love running suspicious code on their machines, am I right?~~):
```
$ ./slowreader
./slowreader: /lib/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.34' not found (required by ./slowreader)
```
Oh boy, glibc incompatibility - glibc this recent will require either backporting or upgrading the entire system, which would both take a lot of work and we don't have that much time in a CTF. Time to do some magic with the Linux dynamic linker! But first, we need to know what version of loader we should use:
```
$ file ./slowreader
./slowreader: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=d31e8e5b0e045dc57571fdf52fdd0d5829182eba, for GNU/Linux 4.4.0, stripped
```
With that, we can just go to [Ubuntu's download page for glibc](https://packages.ubuntu.com/impish/i386/libc6/download) (aka libc6) and grab the deb, unpack with `ar x libc6_2.34-0ubuntu3.2_amd64.deb`, then `zstd -d data.tar.zst` and `tar -xf data.tar` (run it in a separate directory or you will have files scattered around!). Now that we have the libraries, lets try the good ol' `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` trick:
```
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib/i386-linux-gnu/ ./slowreader
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```
Huh, that's really weird - seems like the system default linker which is of the older version is incompatible with the newer glibc libraries. Let's try again by directly calling the linker from the new glibc:
```
$ ./lib/ld-linux.so.2 --library-path ./lib/i386-linux-gnu/ ./slowreader
Usage: slowreader FILE
```
Eyy - now it works as expected. Lets pass the file provided by the challenge as a parameter:
```
$ ./lib/ld-linux.so.2 --library-path ./lib/i386-linux-gnu/ ./slowreader ./haystack.slowreader
Usage: slowreader FILE
```
Looks like it is not accepting the file for some reason. Guess it's time to start our reversing journey:

![argcheck.png](/assets/images/utctf2022/ebook-drm/argcheck.png)

Hmm, it's checking for the `slowreader` string, but we have to pass a valid path to the loader. Might as well just patch the check out entirely by bypassing the `jnz` - with the patch at `1CD7A` `0F 85 C2 00 00 00` -> `90 90 90 90 90 90`, we can try running it again now:
```
$ ./lib/ld-linux.so.2 --library-path ./lib/i386-linux-gnu/ ./slowreader ./haystack.slowreader
Welcome to SlowReader(c) 6.96.9
You are allowed to read 1 line every 2 seconds
Loading file...
Press ENTER to load a line.
```
Nice! It seems to want us to press enter over and over again to advance line by line, but we can do better:

![pressenter.png](/assets/images/utctf2022/ebook-drm/pressenter.png)

Just a simple `getline` call, nothing that can't be patched out. By patching the loop end `jmp` to skip the check with `1CE41` `C0` -> `DD`, we can press enter once and it will loop indefinitely:
```
$ ./lib/ld-linux.so.2 --library-path ./lib/i386-linux-gnu/ ./slowreader ./haystack.slowreader
Welcome to SlowReader(c) 6.96.9
You are allowed to read 1 line every 2 seconds
Loading file...
Press ENTER to load a line.

This is not the needle you are looking for (move along).

```
Great! But now the main problem comes - the lines are still only being read every 2 seconds. How are we gonna deal with it?
<br><br><br>


## ***Wait***, how'd it do that?

The 2 second delay has 2 possibilities - either they used a crude execution loop to time the delay, or they called one of the time related Linux functions to determine their elapsed time. The former seems very unlikely - the delay is very accurate, and the timer knows to delay if we press too fast but allows instantly if we press enter later than the delay, which would require that delay timer to be running in another thread if it was an execution loop. Looking at the imported functions in `extern`, we can prove that it is indeed the latter:

`clock_gettime` is referenced, whereas any threading calls are missing. But how are they referenced? Surely they didn't just make a simple comparison that is easily patched out:

![obfsfun.png](/assets/images/utctf2022/ebook-drm/obfsfun.png)

Yikes - reversing this directly will be a pain for sure. After poking around for quite a bit to see if there is any obvious places for time comparison (taking 2 `tp->tv_sec` at 2 different times and comparing, for example) and patching random bits and pieces, there still wasn't any good hint of how it's called. Tackling it in another direction seems to be time better spent than figuring out how this obfuscation works.

Since `clock_gettime` eventually enters kernel space through a syscall called, you guessed it, `clock_gettime`, `strace` should be able to pick it up, and we can figure out where and how the calls are made using the address information strace provides. Time to fire it up:
```
$ strace ./lib/ld-linux.so.2 --library-path ./lib/i386-linux-gnu/ ./slowreader ./haystack.slowreader

(...)

ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME)                  = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)
getppid()                               = 19426
kill(19426, SIGTERM)                    = 0
strace: Process 19429 detached
Terminated
```
Seems like they actually implemented a typical anti-debug measure using `ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME)` calls - this call fails with EPERM if there is a ptrace parent attached, so the code flow can be redirected, which for this case is into termination. No worries - we can just patch it out if it's simple. Tracing xrefs from the ptrace function, we can see where it's utilized:

![ptraceshennanigans.png](/assets/images/utctf2022/ebook-drm/ptraceshennanigans.png)

Yep, straightforward enough - skipping the `jz` check with `1CF26` `74 12` -> `90 90` should do the job.

```
$ strace ./lib/ld-linux.so.2 --library-path ./lib/i386-linux-gnu/ ./slowreader ./haystack.slowreader

(...)

read(4, "Name:\tstrace\nUmask:\t0077\nState:\t"..., 1024) = 1024
close(4)                                = 0
kill(20063, SIGBUSBus error (core dumped)
$ Press ENTER to load a line.
```

What? strace got terminated by `SIGBUS` while the child process is still going (it detaches from the terminal and goes into background), which really shouldn't be something that the patch can introduce. After a lot of poking around with ptrace returns and such, it ended up being a problem completely unrelated to the patch, but once again glibc itself - it seems like both the parent and the child have to be using the same glibc version. However, we have a slight problem - strace is 64bit, which means we have to fetch the 64bit version of glibc *again* using the same method, and then use **2** loaders to load each one in respectively. 
```
$ ./lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --library-path ./lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ /usr/bin/strace -fi ./lib/ld-linux.so.2 --library-path ./lib/i386-linux-gnu/ ./slowreader ./haystack.slowreader

[f7f32149] statx(4, "", AT_STATX_SYNC_AS_STAT|AT_NO_AUTOMOUNT|AT_EMPTY_PATH, STATX_BASIC_STATS, {stx_mask=STATX_BASIC_STATS, stx_attributes=0, stx_mode=S_IFREG|0444, stx_size=0, ...}) = 0
[f7f32149] read(4, "./lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/"..., 1024) = 247
[f7f32149] close(4)                     = 0
[f7f32149] write(1, "This is not the needle you are l"..., 57This is not the needle you are looking for (move along).
) = 57
```
With an overly long command, we can finally strace reliably - but where did the `clock_gettime` calls go? `-f` should've handled threading, and the program ain't calling any threading functions to begin with. [Upon further reading](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=613969), it seems that `clock_gettime` can now be using vDSO instead of syscalls, which strace cannot log. Guess we are at a dead end - time to find another path in.
<br><br><br>


## Speeding up
Just as I was stuck figuring out what to do next, [@Kevin](../../../authors/Kevin/) gave a great idea: Instead of reversing and patching the `clock_gettime` calls, is there any way to emulate time to speed it up? I know RDTSC emulation and syscall emulation is possible, but writing it ourselves would take quite a bit of time, especially when my only experience emulating RDTSC is for windows and it requires a lot of OS specific internals knowledge.

Apparently though, [@Kevin](../../../authors/Kevin/) noticed one such library that does exactly what we want exists, and it's called [libfaketime](https://github.com/wolfcw/libfaketime) - which can be loaded using `LD_PRELOAD`, but since we are manually invoking loaders, we can just use the `--preload` option instead. After going through the syntax and wondering why it doesnt work even with known working commands like `watch` and `date`, we eventually figured out `FAKETIME` requires a date modifier then a speed modifier. Time to test it out:
```
$ FAKETIME='@2000-01-01 11:12:13 x20000' ./lib/ld-linux.so.2 --library-path ./lib/i386-linux-gnu/ --pre
load "./usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/faketime/libfaketime.so.1" ./slowreader ./haystack.slowreader

```
Woah now that's speed - it is practically running at real time, as if the 2 second restriction was never placed in the first place. All that's left is to wait for it to print all the lines, and then fish out the flag, right?
```

Which after searching for bytes in IDA, maps to address `E058` before ASLR.

![morepain.png](/assets/images/utctf2022/ebook-drm/morepain.png)

Seems like the program is trying to dereference the return value of `fileno` for some reason, which is not a pointer but an integer representing the file descriptor - why would they do that?

Understanding how this happens is probably as difficult as reversing how `clock_gettime` works itself, not to mention how sporadic this failure is even with slow time multipliers - which means it is time to move onto yet another method to try.
<br><br><br>


## Proxying
Thinking back to the days where I used to bypass kernel protection using dll proxying on windows, I suddenly wondered if it is possible on Linux too, in order to grab information directly from the `openssl` `EVP_Decrypt*` functions. This way, we can at least know if the key and iv dynamically changes, and how the program decrypts the haystack file. Turns out, `LD_PRELOAD` allows exactly this with much more ease than windows - it overrides any function of any library with the `.so`s provided to it. Since we mainly want to get the key and iv, we can choose `EVP_DecryptInit_ex` to proxy first, of which the function signature is freely available on [man page](https://linux.die.net/man/3/evp_decryptinit_ex). With that knowledge, we can write something similar to this:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int EVP_DecryptInit_ex(void *ctx, const void *type, void *impl, const unsigned char *key, const unsigned char *iv) {
    int i;

    printf("key 0x");
    for (i=0; i < 32; i++)
        printf("%02x",key[i] & 0xff);

    printf("\niv 0x");

    for (i=0; i < 16; i++)
        printf("%02x",iv[i] & 0xff);
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```
Note that the specific struct pointers are all changed to `void*` to avoid needing to link openssl libraries, since we don't need them anyways. The key and iv sizes are fixed - AES-256-CBC requires 32 bytes for key and 16 bytes for iv respectively. Compiling with `gcc -fPIC -shared -m32 evpintercept.c -o evpintercept.so` and preloading it gets us:
```

Nice, we got the first key! However, since we are writing a stub that prints and returns without doing the actual decrypt init routines, it segfaults right afterwards as expected. We would like to see whether there are more keys and ivs that are being used after this initial load - the file might be segmented into chunks of data with different keys that the program computes and cycles through. This is where dynamic linking comes into play - we can utilize the `dlopen` and `dlsym` functions, which are analogous to `LoadLibraryEx` and `GetProcAddress` for Windows, to get a function pointer to call on.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <dlfcn.h>

int EVP_DecryptInit_ex(void *ctx, const void *type, void *impl, const unsigned char *key, const unsigned char *iv) {
    int i;

    printf("key 0x");
    for (i=0; i < 32; i++)
        printf("%02x",key[i] & 0xff);

    printf("\niv 0x");

    for (i=0; i < 16; i++)
        printf("%02x",iv[i] & 0xff);
    printf("\n");

    void *handle = dlopen("/usr/lib/libssl.so.1.1", RTLD_NOW);

    int (*orig_func)() = dlsym(handle, "EVP_DecryptInit_ex");
    return orig_func(ctx, type, impl, key, iv);
}
```
Compiling and preloading again gives us the following output:
```

Nice! It's not segfaulting anymore, and it doesn't seem like the key and iv is ever changed. Just to be sure that the keys are for decrypting the haystack file, we can proxy `EVP_DecryptUpdate` to check what the keys are being used for:
```c
int EVP_DecryptUpdate(void *ctx, unsigned char *out,int *outl, unsigned char *in, int inl) {

     int i;

     printf("ciphertext of length 0x%d: 0x", inl);
     for (i=0; i < inl; i++)
       printf("%02x",in[i] & 0xff);
     printf("\n");

     void *handle = dlopen("/usr/lib/libssl.so.1.1", RTLD_NOW);


     int (*orig_func)() = dlsym(handle, "EVP_DecryptUpdate");
     int ret = orig_func(ctx, out, outl, in, inl);

     printf("plaintext of length 0x%d: %s\n\n", *outl, out);

     return ret;
}
```
Time to check what prints after we press enter:
```

Exactly what we are looking for! Time to try the keys out and hope for the best.

## Finding the needle in the haystack
I've always had a tendency to screw up code for encryption and decryption for some reason, but [@Kevin](../../../authors/Kevin/) is once again back to save my *bacon*, and he quickly whipped up a decrypter:
```py
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

key = bytes.fromhex("4498a9650fa72cf38d0777a611b33c140172cfef7bda174fba255c4a59551678")
iv = bytes.fromhex("3d07501c1386909a3eee28e8e97a5e29")
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC)
f = open("haystack.slowreader", "rb")
ct = f.read()
pt = cipher.decrypt(ct)
g = open("flag.txt", "wb")
g.write(pt)
```
Looking at the file, we see some junk in the header and footer, but:
```
slowreader book
This is not the needle you are looking for (move along).
This is not the needle you are looking for (move along).
This is not the needle you are looking for (move along).
```
It worked! All that's left is to actually find the *flag* in the *textstacks* - something we can easily do with a simple ctrl-f for `utflag`. Thus finally we have the flag:

`utflag{ghidra_isnt_always_the_answer}`
